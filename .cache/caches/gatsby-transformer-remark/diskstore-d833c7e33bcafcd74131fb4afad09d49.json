After searching on the web, I chose to travel to Malaysia in order to spend 3 months there (2 months and 17 days to be precise), I knew that Kuala Lumpur’s weather wasn’t healthy, so I decided to spend the first month there, then move on to Penang Island for the second month then finally get back to KL to eventually move back to my home country.</p>\n<p>I actually had other ideas, like going to Bali to spend half of the second month there, but due to Bali’s weather, I decided to spend the whole second month in Penang.</p>\n<p>So as a remote developer, I’d like to share my experience of spending a month here in KL with you covering most of the parts that you might worry about before coming here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There will be an upcoming article about Penang Island as well, make sure to subscribe to the news letter in order to get my latest articles delivered right to your inbox!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"planning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#planning\" aria-label=\"planning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Planning</h2>\n<p>Before you start packing your stuff &#x26; booking your flight, you must plan everything way earlier in order to avoid touristic seasons, so don’t rush things out and don’t forget to check the weather as well, in my case I had planned to get here since January, I targeted the season in between April &#x26; June as after June, everyone is in holidays and the area becomes so touristic and the cost of living raises way higher than during the normal seasons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flight-rebound\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#flight-rebound\" aria-label=\"flight rebound permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Flight (rebound)</h2>\n<p>I made a mistake booking my flight late, I should have booked a couple of months earlier to get the price down in between $ 500 - $ 700 from Casablanca, Morocco to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia instead of the actual price I paid which was in between $ 800 - $ 900 with Oman Air.
